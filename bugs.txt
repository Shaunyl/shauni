1) Fix conversion from db to java of Date fields.
    -> time is lost, i.e., 2017-02-05 23:15:00 becomes --> 2017-02-05 00:00:00
FIXED!

2) Montbs creates the report file also if the job fails

3) Bad perfromances SimpleMonTbs when growing option is enabled
FIXING...! Using a view..

Repetitions -> 100 * 4 tablespaces = 400

        VIEW    TABLE
        =====   =====
AVG     20,61	25,18    <4.57 ms (on disk)
SUM     2061     2518    <457  ms (on disk)

Normally a database contains plenty of tablespaces, but the code run just once, so:

Repetitions -> 1 * X tablespaces = X

I should test a much bigger enviroment

Another possible implementation could be to retrieve all the data, then, scan on them with Java

4) AutoMontbs lacks of a growing option implementation but the command would not throw any errors if used.
